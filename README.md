# Welcome to Documentation

# Welcome to Remix!
- ðŸ“– [Remix docs](https://remix.run/docs)
## Development
Run the dev server:
```sh
npm run dev
```
## Deployment
First, build your app for production:
```sh
npm run build
```
Then run the app in production mode:
```sh
npm start
```
Now you'll need to pick a host to deploy it to.
### DIY
If you're familiar with deploying Node applications, the built-in Remix app server is production-ready.
Make sure to deploy the output of `npm run build`
- `build/server`
- `build/client`
